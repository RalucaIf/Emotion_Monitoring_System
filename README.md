# Emotion Monitoring System
## Introduction
The Emotion Monitoring System is a project that monitors physiological parameters to evaluate stress levels and emotional states in real-time. By analyzing different indicators such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and body temperature, the system helps users understand and manage their stress levels effectively. With an easy-to-read display and intuitive feedback mechanisms like colored LEDs and auditory alerts, the system delivers immediate results that are easy to interpret. Additionally, it leverages IoT technology to transmit data to an online dashboard, enabling users to track their stress trends over time and gain a deeper understanding of their emotional health.

## Overview
The project integrates multiple sensors to:

* Measure physiological parameters:
    - Heart rate and variability using the MAX30102 sensor.
    - Galvanic skin response (GSR) for stress detection.
    - Body temperature with the DHT22 sensor.
* Provide real-time feedback:
    - Visual feedback through RGB LEDs.
    - Auditory alerts using a buzzer.
    - Display of real-time data on an OLED screen.
* Send data to an IoT dashboard for remote monitoring and historical tracking
